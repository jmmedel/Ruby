BEGIN and END Blocks
Every Ruby source file can declare blocks of code to be run as the file is being loaded (the BEGIN blocks) and after the program has finished executing (the END blocks).

    
=end


#!/usr/bin/ruby

BEGIN { 
    # BEGIN block code 
    puts "BEGIN code block"
 } 
 
 END { 
    # END block code 
    puts "END code block"
 }
    # MAIN block code 
 puts "MAIN code block"

A program may include multiple BEGIN and END blocks. BEGIN blocks are executed in the order they are encountered. END blocks are executed in reverse order. When executed, the above program produces the following result âˆ’

BEGIN code block
MAIN code block
END code block


=end
