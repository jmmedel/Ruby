Ruby - Loops

    Loops in Ruby are used to execute the same block of code a specified number of times. This chapter details all the loop statements supported by Ruby.

Ruby while Statement
Syntax
while conditional [do]
   code
end
Executes code while conditional is true. A while loop's conditional is separated from code by the reserved word do, a newline, backslash \, or a semicolon ;.

Example
=end

#!/usr/bin/ruby

$i = 0
$num = 5

while $i < $num  do
   puts("Inside the loop i = #$i" )
   $i +=1
end


=begin



This will produce the following result âˆ’

Inside the loop i = 0
Inside the loop i = 1
Inside the loop i = 2
Inside the loop i = 3
Inside the loop i = 4


=end
